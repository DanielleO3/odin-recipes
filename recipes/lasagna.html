    <h1> Zoodle Lasagne </h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg">

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p> I'm a pasta lover to the core, but never tried veggie filled pasta! I wanted to try something different and
        came across zucchini noodles, also known as "Zoodles". Zoodles are a delicious healthy gluten-free pasta
        alternative made from zucchini! The best part of zoodles, they are good for you and actually taste really
        good.You can never go wrong with a good ol' lasagna.
    </p>

    <p> This Zucchini Noodle Lasagna is easy to make. It is made with fresh zucchini noodles instead of pasta. Not only
        is this version gluten free, keto friendly, and packed with vegetables, it stills includes that cheesy lasagna
        flavor. Just a bit lighter and healthier. (A definite win).</p>




    Ingredients
    <ul>
        <li>4 zucchini</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups homemade or store-bought tomato sauce</li>
        <li>⅔ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bechamel sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese </li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh basil, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    Steps
    <ol>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</ol>
    <ol>Cut zucchini lengthwise into 1/4-inch thick slices with a knife or mandolin.</ol>
    <ol>Pour 2 tablespoons tomato sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange zucchini slices in a single
        layer, slightly overlapping, over tomato sauce.</ol>
    <ol>Top with a thin layer of mozzarella, 1/3 of the bechamel (see Editor's Note), 1/3 of remaining tomato sauce, 1/3
        of the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and 1/3 of the basil. Repeat layers, topping with bechamel and Parmigiano
        Reggiano cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, about 35 minutes. Allow to set
        until remaining liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.</ol>
